### Common library template
- default values -> `common values.yaml`
- override values -> `component values.yaml`

This chart contains reusable templates called `named templates` as they can be invoked in other charts by name.<br>
The structure and content of the chart are based on the output from a helm `create` command.<br>
File `_helpers.tpl` is an autogenerated file that contains functions that defne best practices for naming conventions, for example :
- `common.name` based on the chart name.
- `common.fullname` based on the chart name and the release name.
- `common.chart` based on the chart name and version.
  `_.` is used to prevent Helm from trying to create manifests using that specific chart.<br>
