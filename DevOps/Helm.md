# Helm

Is used in a `Kubernetes` environment to bundle and configure the microservices for `deployments`.<br>
A package is known as a `chart`.<br>
A `chart` contains `templates`, default values for the templates and optional dependencies. <br>
Each component that needs to be deployed will have its own chart describing how to deploy it.<br>
`Library charts` named `common` are used to reduce the boilerplate definitions from the component charts.<br>
A `library chart` doesn't contain any deployable definitions but only reusable templates.<br>
To deploy all components into different types of environments the concept of `parent charts` and `subcharts` will be
used.<br>
Each environment will be implemented as a parent chart that depends on different sets of subcharts.<br>
`Helm charts` can be published to a `helm chart repository`.<br>

```

- **Chart.yaml** contains general information about the chart and a list of other charts it depends on.
- **templates** a folder that contains that will be used to deploy the chart.
- **values.yaml** contains the default values for the templates.
- **Chart.lock** a file created by Helm to keep track of the versions of the dependencies.
- **charts** a folder that contains the dependencies of the chart.
- **.helmignore** a file that contains the files that should be ignored by Helm.

## Commands

- **create**
- **dependency update**
- **dependency build** rebuilds the dependencies based on the Chart.lock file.
- **template** renders the chart templates locally.
- **install:** installs a chart archive.
- **install --dry-run** simulate a deployment without performing it
- **list** lists all installations in the current namespace.
- **upgrade** updates aan existing installation.
- **uninstall** removes an installation.

## Templates

To parameterize Kubernetes manifest files define a common template that contains placeholders
for where microservice-specific values will be placed in the template, when a manifest is rendered for a specific
microservice.<br>
`kubernetes/helm/common/templates/_deployment.yaml`

```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: {{ include "common.fullname" . }}
spec:
  replicas: {{ .Values.replicaCount }}
  template:
    spec:
      containers:
        - name: {{ .Chart.Name }}
```
It is different from the standard Kubernetes manifest file because it uses `{{ }}` to define placeholders for values.
- `{{ include "common.fullname" . }}` is used to invoke other templates.

The other two constructs are used to insert values using one of the built-in objects in Helm.<br>
The most frequently used parts of the built-in objects are:
- `.Values` Used to refer to values in the chartâ€™s values.yaml
- `Release` Used to provide metadata regarding the current release that is installed
    - `Release.Name` The name of the release
    - `Release.Namespace` The namespace of the release
    - `Release.Service` The service that is used to install the release(helm)
- `Chart` Used to access information from the Chart.yaml file
    - `Chart.Name` The name of the chart
    - `Chart.Version` The version of the chart
- `Files` Containing functions for accessing chart-specific files
    - `Files.Glob` Returns files in a chart based on a glob pattern.<br>
        For example, the pattern "config-repo/*" will return all files found in the folder config-repo
    - `AsConfig` Returns the content of files as a YAML map appropriate for declaring values in a ConfigMap
    - `Files.GetSecret` Used to get the contents of a secret
- `Capabilities` an be used to find information regarding the capabilities of the Kubernetes cluster that the installation is performed on.<br>
    For example, a template can use information in this object to adopt a manifest based on what API versions the actual Kubernetes cluster supports.

The single dot `.` is used to refer to the current scope.<br>
The dollar sign `$` is used to refer to the root scope.<br>
Helm templates support the declaration of variables to reference other objects
```yaml
$name := .Release.Name
```
