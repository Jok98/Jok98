## Fundamentals

- **log N** -> the execution time is logarithmic in programs that resolve a problem by dividing it into two smaller problems of the same type or similar.<br>
  - when N is double up its value log N is increasing by a constant amount, but don't double up until N becomes N^2.
            
- **N** -> the execution time is linear in programs that resolve a problem by iterating over a list of N elements.
  - if N is double up its value, the execution time is double up too.

- **N log N** -> is used in programs that resolve a problem by dividing it into different independent problems then combine the results.
  - if N double up its value then N log N is a bit much more than double up of its value.
